# 🎨 PixelAlchemy: Text-to-Image Generation with Auto-Description

## ✨ Overview
**PixelAlchemy** is a generative AI project that transforms text prompts into vivid images using Stable Diffusion.  
It’s designed not just as a technical demo, but as a portfolio showcase — highlighting my ability to build, deploy, and polish ML/AI apps with real-world constraints.

---

## 🌟 Portfolio Note
PixelAlchemy is part of my AI portfolio, built to demonstrate practical ML engineering, creative branding, and transparency through live demos.

---

## 🚀 Features
- 🖼️ **Text-to-Image Generation** — powered by Stable Diffusion v1.5  
- 📝 **Auto-Description** — BLIP captions each generated image for transparency  
- 📊 **Lightweight Logging** — reproducible outputs for review  
- 🌐 **Live Demo** — deployed on Hugging Face Spaces
